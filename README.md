# ReVanced Builder

This project will allow you to download the YouTube APK and build ReVanced easily!

With version 2.0.0, now ReVanced Builder is no longer a CLI application, but a GUI app! It's now much more easier to use it!

## Required

You'll need at least [Zulu JDK 17](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk) and [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) (optional, required only for rooted phones).

If you plan to use it from source, you'll also require [NodeJS >=16](https://nodejs.org/).

## How to use

Download the latest [executable](https://github.com/reisxd/revanced-builder/releases/latest) and if you are on Windows, unzip it and run it!
